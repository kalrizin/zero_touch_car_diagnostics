Supported OBD-II PIDs
The app supports all generic Mode 01 PIDs including:

Engine: RPM, load, timing advance, oil temperature
Fuel: Pressure, trim (bank 1/2), level, consumption rate
Temperature: Coolant, intake air, ambient
Airflow: MAF, intake manifold pressure

System: OBD standards, fuel type, distance traveled
Diagnostics: Monitor status, freeze frame, DTCs
See lib/services/obd_pid_registry.dart for complete list.

Trip Logging & Route Analysis
Damage Scoring Algorithm
The app calculates a real-time damage score based on:

Accelerometer: Harsh acceleration/braking (>15 m/s²)
Gyroscope: Sharp turns and sudden maneuvers
OBD Data:
High RPM (>4000 rpm)
Engine load (>80%)
Overheating (>100°C coolant)
Route Recommendations
Based on historical trip data:

Groups trips by similar start/end points
Calculates average damage score per route
Factors in time and distance
Recommends best route with lowest wear
Notes on Accuracy
AI diagnostics accuracy depends on:

Completeness of OBD data available from vehicle
Quality of sensor readings
Gemini model's training data
Prompt engineering and structured output format
The app uses strict JSON schema responses from Gemini to ensure consistent, parseable diagnostics
